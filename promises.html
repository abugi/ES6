     A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder into which the successful result value or reason for failure will materialize.
     Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

     SYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS run from top to bottom in a sequence.These programs may or may not face blocking operation that affects their run-time.

     ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS runs on an event loop engine. When a blocking operation happens, these operations are diverted to an event handler. So the programs keeps running without a block ever happening.

     //Promise can be created using the promise constructor as follows:
     const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { 
     //resolve holds the data for when the operation is successful
     //reject holds the data for when the operation is not successful
          resolve('Resolved Promise Data');
     });
     promise.catch(error => console.log(error))
     .then(response => console.log(response));
