     A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder into which the successful result value or reason for failure will materialize.
     Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

     SYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS run from top to bottom in a sequence.These programs may or may not face blocking operation that affects their run-time.

     ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS runs on an event loop engine. When a blocking operation happens, these operations are diverted to an event handler. So the programs keeps running without a block ever happening.
     */

     //Promise can be created using the promise constructor as follows:
     const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { 
     //resolve holds the data for when the operation is successful
     //reject holds the data for when the operation is not successful
          resolve('Resolved Promise Data'); //the string is assumed to be the returned data
     });
     //to access the returned data, we use the .then method
     promise.then(response => console.log(response))
     .catch(error => console.log(error));

     /*
     However, most people are consumers of already-created promises returned from functions. This following guide will therefore explore consumption of returned promises.

     //OLD-STYLE FUNCTIONS (call-back)
     // function successCallback(result) {
     //      console.log("It succeeded with " + result);
     // }

     // function failureCallback(error) {
     //      console.log("It failed with " + error);
     // }

     // //doSomething(successCallback, failureCallback);

     // //but modern functions return a promise you can attach your callbacks to instead
     // let _promise = doSomething(); 
     // _promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);
     //or
     //doSomething().then(successCallback, failureCallback);
