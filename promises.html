     A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
     Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

     SYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS run from top to bottom in a sequence.These programs may or may not face blocking operation that affects their run-time.

     ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS runs on an event loop engine. When a blocking operation happens, these operations are diverted to an event handler. So the programs keeps running without a block ever happening.
