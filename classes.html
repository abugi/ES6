     /*
     Some JavaScript values have other values associated with them. These associations
     are called properties. Every string, for example, has a property called
     length, which refers to an integer, the amount of characters in that string.
     Properties can be accessed in two ways, either with brackets or using dot
     notation:
     */
     var text = "purple haze";
     text["length"]; //11
     text.length; //11
     /*
     The dot notation is a shorthand for the bracket notation, and it works only when the
     name of the property is a valid variable name—when it doesn’t have any
     spaces or symbols in it and does not start with a digit character.
     Trying to read a property from the values null and undefined will cause
     an error. Numbers and Booleans do have properties, but none of them is
     interesting or useful enough to be discussed here.
