     /*
     Some JavaScript values have other values associated with them. These associations
     are called properties. Every string, for example, has a property called
     length, which refers to an integer, the amount of characters in that string.
     Properties can be accessed in two ways, either with brackets or using dot
     notation:
     */
     var text = "purple haze";
     text["length"]; //11
     text.length; //11
     /*
     The dot notation is a shorthand for the bracket notation, and it works only when the
     name of the property is a valid variable name—when it doesn’t have any
     spaces or symbols in it and does not start with a digit character.
     Trying to read a property from the values null and undefined will cause
     an error. Numbers and Booleans do have properties, but none of them is
     interesting or useful enough to be discussed here.
     */

     //Object Values
     /*
     In most value types, if they have properties at all, they are fixed, and you are
     not allowed to change them. (A string’s length always stays the same, for example.)
     However, there is one type of value, objects, where properties can be
     freely added, removed, and changed. The main role of objects, in fact, is to
     be a collection of properties.
     An object can be written like this:
     */
     var cat = {color: "gray", name: "Spot", size: 46};
     cat.size = 47;
     cat.size; //47
     delete cat.size;
     cat.size; //undefined

     /*
     Prototypes are a powerful, if somewhat confusing, part of
     the way JavaScript objects work. Every object is based on a prototype, which
     gives it a set of inherent properties. The simple objects we have used so far
     are based on the most basic prototype, which is associated with the Object
     constructor, and are thus shared by all objects. (Typing {}, by the way, is
     equivalent to typing new Object().)

     function Rabbit(adjective) {
     this.adjective = adjective;
     this.speak = function(line) {
     print("The ", this.adjective, " rabbit says '", line, "'");
