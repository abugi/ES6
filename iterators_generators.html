     //Iterators
     /*
     An object is an iterator when it knows how to access items from a collection one at a time, while keeping track of its current position within that sequence. 
     In JavaScript an iterator is an object that provides a next() method which returns the next item in the sequence. This method returns an object with two properties: done and value.
     */

     //Once created, an iterator object can be used explicitly by repeatedly calling next().
     function makeIterator(array) {
          var nextIndex = 0;
          
          return {
               next: function() {
                    return nextIndex < array.length ?
                         {value: array[nextIndex++], done: false} :
                         {done: true};
               }
          };
     }

     //Once initialized, the next() method can be called to access key-value pairs from the object in turn:
     var it = makeIterator(['musa', 'abugi']);
     console.log(it.next().value); // 'musa'
     console.log(it.next().value); // 'abugi'
     console.log(it.next().done);  // true

     //Generators
     /*
     While custom iterators are a useful tool, their creation requires careful programming due to the need to explicitly maintain their internal state. Generators provide a powerful alternative: they allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function which can maintain its own state.
     A GeneratorFunction is a special type of function that works as a factory for iterators. When it is executed it returns a new Generator object. A function becomes a GeneratorFunction if it uses the function* syntax.
