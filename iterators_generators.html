     //Iterators
     /*
     An object is an iterator when it knows how to access items from a collection one at a time, while keeping track of its current position within that sequence. 
     In JavaScript an iterator is an object that provides a next() method which returns the next item in the sequence. This method returns an object with two properties: done and value.
