     Modules are reusable pieces of code within our application. Modules exist in their own separate files and helps to split (modularize) our code. ES6 modules are file-based, meaning one module per file. At this time, there is no standardized way of combining multiple modules into a single file.
     Modules are very useful because it prevents our page from becoming exessively long and difficult to read.
     We can send this file out using the "export" keyword and and we can reuse it in any part of our application using the "import" keyword.
