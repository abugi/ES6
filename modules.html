     Modules are reusable pieces of code within our application. Modules exist in their own separate files and helps to split (modularize) our code.
     this is very useful because it prevents our page from becoming exessively long and difficult to read.
     We can send this file out using the "export" keyword and and we can reuse it in any part of our application using the "import" keyword.
