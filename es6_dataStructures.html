     //Objects and maps compared
     /*Objects are similar to Maps in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Because of this (and because there were no built-in alternatives), Objects have been used as Maps historically; 
     however, there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases:
     */
     
     //Differences between Map and Object
     /*
     1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
     2. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
     3. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
     4. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
     5. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

     Map methods
     1. map.set(key, value) //sets the value of the key in map object and returns the map object

     3. map.values() //returns a new iterator object that contains the of each element in the map object in insertion order

     5. map.entries() //Returns a new Iterator object that contains an array of [key, value] for each element in the Map object in insertion order.

     6. map.has(key) //Returns a boolean asserting whether a value has been associated to the key in the Map object or not.

     7. map.delete(key) //Returns true if an element in the Map object existed and has been removed, or false if the element does not exist. Map.prototype.has(key) will return false afterwards.
