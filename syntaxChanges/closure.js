	From a purely academic perspective, what is said of the above 
	snippet is that the function bar() has a closure over the scope 
	of foo() (and indeed, even over the rest of the scopes it has 
	access to, such as the global scope in our case). Put slightly 
	differently, itâ€™s said that bar() closes over the scope of foo(). 
	Why? Because bar() appears nested inside of foo(). Plain and simple.
